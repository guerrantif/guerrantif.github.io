  description: "Originally from [IT], currently in [DE]"

about:
  research: "I'm a PhD researcher at [TUM](https://www.tum.de), working with the [DAML](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml) chair under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Stephan Günnemann](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml/guennemann/). My research focuses on machine learning for graphs and structured data, covering representation methods, theoretical foundations, and practical applications."

  philosophy: "I aim to make things work better, whatever that means. Clarity and simplicity in design guide my work, and I pursue minimalism and efficiency as ongoing principles. As we say in Italy, \"<span class=\"highlight-primary\">meglio poco ma buono</span>\" — better less, but better."

  personal: "I'm passionate about endurance sports, particularly triathlon and long-distance events. The discipline and systematic training they demand mirror my approach to research and problem-solving. I value the challenge of optimizing performance, mental and physical, across different aspects of life."
