I am a PhD researcher at [TUM](https://www.tum.de), focusing on machine learning for graphs and structured data.  
Outside research, I’m interested in endurance sports, science-based approaches to personal development, and the balance between mental and physical well-being.

## why everything is lowercase

- It shifts attention toward content and ideas rather than typographic convention.  
- Reading research suggests lowercase can be less visually taxing and more fluent.[^1] [^2]  
- As a stylistic choice, it makes the site feel more approachable[^3] (I hope!).
