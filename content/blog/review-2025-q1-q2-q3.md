## Preface

First retrospective that I publish on the website. I honestly haven't written any proper review this year, so I thought it would be a good idea to start now. Better late than never.

I see this as an exercise to reflect on many different aspects of life, including my work, sports, personal achievements, and challenges. By nature I am prone to analyze what I do in a rather structured way, but for some reasons, converting those thoughts into written words has always been an insurmountable wall for me.

I tried consistent journaling many times during the past 10 years, but it never really stuck. Probably knowing that those notes could be potentially read by others (despite making sure to keep them private) prevented me from being completely honest and open in my reflections. Yet, I feel an inner urge to write these things down, to clarify my mental processes and gain a deeper understanding of myself.

You might wonder: "Why, then, publish it online?"

I don't know. Maybe it's the responsibility that comes with having an audience, however small. Knowing that others might read my thoughts pushes me to articulate them more clearly and thoughtfully. It transforms a private reflection into a public dialogue, inviting feedback and connection. In a way, it's a commitment to my own growth and accountability.

{{ highlight(body="Commitment") }}. This is what I'm missing; hence, this is what I want to cultivate through this practice.

Time to get to the meat of the matter. During one of the many periods of my life when I was journaling and documenting my daily struggles, I defined a specific template that I would follow to write this kind of quarterly reviews[^1]. It would include sections that called for actionable insights and reflections, or specific questions that would make it easier for me to fill it out.

I've decided to go freely know. This doesn't mean I will not follow a structure, but rather this will be kind of spontaneous and not optimized for some metric.
