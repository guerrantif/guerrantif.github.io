## research

i'm a phd researcher at [tum](https://www.tum.de), working with the [daml](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml) chair under the supervision of [prof. dr. stephan günnemann](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml/team/guennemann/). my research focuses on machine learning for graphs and structured data, covering representation methods, theoretical foundations, and practical applications.

## philosophy

i aim to improve systems, sometimes through deliberate over-engineering. clarity and simplicity in design guide my work, and i pursue minimalism and efficiency as ongoing principles. as we say in italy, "meglio poco ma buono" — better less, but better.

## personal

i'm passionate about endurance sports, particularly triathlon and long-distance events. the discipline and systematic training they demand mirror my approach to research and problem-solving. i value the challenge of optimizing performance, mental and physical, across different aspects of life.
