Welcome to my personal corner of the internet. Here you can find out more about me, my work, and my interests.

## TL;DR

- Italian living in Munich.
- PhD researcher at [TUM](https://www.tum.de), working with the [DAML](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml) chair under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Stephan GÃ¼nnemann](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml/guennemann/).
- Passionate about endurance sports, particularly triathlon and long-distance events.

If I were to describe myself in one sentence, that would be:

> "_Lifelong **learner** with a passion for **data**-driven insights and general **well-being**._"

This translates into different aspects of my life, from work to hobbies.
The keywords, as you may easily infer, are:

- **Learning**: I really enjoy deepening my knowledge of "stuff", being it technical quirks or philosophical dilemmas.
- **Data**: data gives us access to patterns and insights that can help us steer our decisions and actions in a more informed way.
- **Well-being**: as the Latins said, "[_Mens sana in corpore sano_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_sana_in_corpore_sano)". I strive to maintain a balance between my mental and physical well-being.

## Why this website?

- It is apparently very common for researchers in computer science and machine learning to have a personal website.
- It is hard for me to have a public presence online, and I see it as an opportunity to exit my comfort zone.
- I like the idea of having a personal space where I can share whatever I find interesting or valuable.

## What can you expect to find here?

- **Research**: Insights and updates on my ongoing research projects.
- **Thoughts**: Reflections on various topics related (and not limited) to machine learning, sports, and personal development.
