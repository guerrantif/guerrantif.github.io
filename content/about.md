## Who am I?

I'm an Italian PhD researcher in machine learning at [TUM](https://www.tum.de), based in Munich and working with the [DAML](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml) chair under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Stephan GÃ¼nnemann](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml/guennemann/). You can explore my [research publications](/research) to learn more about my work in graph neural networks and structured data.  
Outside research, I spend much of my time training for triathlons and long-distance events.

If I had to describe myself in a single line, it would be:

> _A curious mind drawn to **learning**, guided by **data**, and committed to **well-being**._

These aren't abstract buzzwords for me, but instead resonate with my daily experiences and values:

- **Learning**: from debugging obscure technical issues to exploring philosophical questions.  
- **Data**: both as the foundation of my research and as a tool to make sense of patterns in life and sport.  
- **Well-being**: I try to balance mental focus with physical training, following the old idea of a _mens sana in corpore sano_.

## Why this website?

Three main reasons:  

- **Societal**: Many times I've been stuck until I stumbled on a half-forgotten blog post that had the exact solution to my problem. Sharing knowledge online helps others in the same way.  
- **Personal**: I'm naturally introverted, and maintaining a public site pushes me to step outside my comfort zone.  
- **Professional**: It's also a place to showcase research and ideas, something common in computer science and machine learning circles.

## What you'll find here

- **Research**: updates and insights on my projects in my [research section](/research).  
- **Thoughts**: reflections on machine learning, computer science, technology, well-being, sports, and personal development shared through my [blog](/blog).
