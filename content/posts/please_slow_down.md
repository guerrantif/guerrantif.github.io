# I remember simplicity and slowness

Oh, what a good time it was to be a kid. I wouldn't say I had the easiest life one could imagine, but, looking back at those days, I realize how easier life was.
Maybe not necessarily better, but I'm confident in saying that it was way less complicated than it is now.

My mom would wake me up every morning with the gentle sound of her voice, or with some louder calls when she was not in the mood for subtlety.
I would then have a classic Italian kid breakfast ([Gocciole biscuits](https://www.gocciole.it) and milk[^1]), while thinking about the bad dream that I had the night before.
My father would then bring me to school, in a mix of silence and random rhetorical questions, such as "What subject do you have first?" or "Do you have football practice today?"

Once at school, I would occasionally listen to the teacher's lecture, while my mind would wander off to other topics or to the book that I was hiding behind the assignment notebook.
At 10:30, we would have a "short" break, during which my friends and I would talk about the organization of our super secret club. So secret that almost all the school was aware of it[^2].
I loved the morning break. And then back to the classroom for some more lectures.

At 13:30, I would take the school bus to my grandma's house. I could smell the delicious aroma of the meal she

My main concern during a typical day was, probably, what would my grandma prepare for lunch, or what would happen to Goku during the next episode.

But wait. Don't jump into conclusions.

It's usually normal to look at the past and think of it as an easier time: all challenges we faced back then look now trivial; all problems seem smaller in hindsight.
True, but only because we were eventually able to overcome them and grow from those experiences.
We now know how to tackle similar challenges more effectively, and, most importantly, we know that we will get through them.

Is it then fair to label the past as just simpler?

Of course not. Every moment in life has its own challenges and complexities. And every challenge is a challenge because it was significant to us at that time.
But what I want to focus on here, it's not philosophical musings about the nature of time and challenges, but rather the tangible differences in how we lived our lives 20 years ago versus now.

as a kid:

- slow morning
- take written notes, spend time writing, correcting, studying them
- use of encyclopedias for deep dives into topics
- watch the same cartoon series every afternoon after school at 2pm, then go play outside
- calling my grandma at dinner time, just to chat
- read a book before going to bed

# The advent of technology

- advent of the internet
  - access to my father's computer
  - discovery of wikipedia -> research became easier
- phone
  - communicate to parents where i'd be
  - instant messaging with friends
- ipod
  - music and games everywhere
  - afternoon's cartoon became background noise
- netlog/facebook/...
  - connecting with friends to the extreme
  - no more games, but web socializing took over
- smartphone
  - everything became mobile
  - social media at our fingertips
  - wikipedia-like platforms for information
  - general googling for everything
  - youtube for different knowledge retrieval (e.g., 3blue1brown and similar)


# Abundance, abundance, abundance, abundance, and yet abundance

- information overload
- constant notifications
- surrounded by screens, words, information everywhere
- constant dopamine hits, always seeking the next reward
- unable to get "bored"
- next video on youtube
- netflix overwatching
- endless scrolling on social media

## Large language models

- deep research simplified
  - looking for something takes seconds instead of hours
  - summary of information in seconds -> no need to read long articles
  - why writing, if it can be generated instantly?
  - why thinking, if llms can "think" for us?

- i built this website in hours, not days.
  - have i learned anything in the process?
  - have i truly understood the concepts, or just skimmed the surface?

# Minimalism

- in this abundance, we must find to simplify and get back to the essentials
  - focus on less things, but with more depth
  - embrace solitude and reflection
  - prioritize quality over quantity
  - rediscover the challenge of deep work and the rewards coming from it
