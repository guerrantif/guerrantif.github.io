My research focuses on machine learning for **graphs** and **structured data**. I am particularly interested in **modeling long-range interactions** and **graph encoding methods**, with a recent focus on **injecting structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs)**. Beyond methodological work, I have also explored applications in the **biological domain**, where structured data is abundant and complex.
