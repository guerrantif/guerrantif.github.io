I'm happy to hear from anyone interested in research collaborations, questions about my work, or discussions on related topics. Feel free to explore my [research publications](/research) before reaching out to get a sense of my current work and interests. To help me respond effectively, it's useful if messages are brief and focused on topics related to my research or professional interests. I try to reply within a week, though it may take a little longer at busy times.
