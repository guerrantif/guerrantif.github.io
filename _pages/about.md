Hello everybody, I'm **Filippo**! Welcome to my personal page ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in [Data Analytics and Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/home/){:target="_blank"} at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Prof. Stephan GÃ¼nnemann](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/team/damlguennemann/){:target="_blank"}. My interests lie in the fields of machine learning and deep learning for graph-structured data. 

I received my master's degree in Computer and Automation Engineering at the [Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics](https://www.diism.unisi.it/en){:target="_blank"} with a thesis on *relational reasoning learning*. The thesis is titled *Approximating Logical Reasoning using Neural Network* and aims to enable machines to reason about related entities using a priori knowledge. I was also a member of the Siena Artificial Intelligence Lab ([SAILab](http://sailab.diism.unisi.it/people/filippo-guerranti/){:target="_blank"}), [University of Siena](https://en.unisi.it){:target="_blank"}, lead by [Prof. Marco Gori](https://www3.diism.unisi.it/~marco/).

My goal as a PhD student is to study and deepen my knowledge to become an independent researcher and to create machine learning models that are reliable, robust under uncertainties, and fair. This will enable us to safely use them in sensitive and critical real-world situations without losing efficiency and performance.

In my spare time I enjoy CrossFit, running, hiking, mountain biking in the woods and hills of Tuscany (now in the woods and hills of Munich) and, occasionally, bouldering (I'm still a beginner). At certain times of the year I'm also an avid reader (books on psychology, sociology, popular science and novels), at other times I just can't open a book.

**Research interests**: graph representation learning, graph structure learning, graph contrastive learning, relational reasoning.
